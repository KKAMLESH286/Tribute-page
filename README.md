# Tribute-page

This is first project of freecodecamp.org.
This project is a tribute page for Swami Vivekananda.
I have finished this project in just 3 hours. I made it first in figma then code it in VS code editor. 
This is a responsive page so it is compatible on big screens such as desktops and laptops as well as on small screens(tabs and mobile devices).
